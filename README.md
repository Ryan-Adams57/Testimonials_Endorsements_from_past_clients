Testimonials Endorsements from past clients:

"My organization initially hired Ryan to help update our fleet of Macs to Big Sur and configure our Jamf instance to support Apple Silicon. Not only did he succeed in these tasks, but he also helped us improve our overall Mac management. Ryan exceeded expectations by not only completing the requested work but also proactively suggesting enhancements and providing resources that empowered my team to manage our resources independently. Ryan is knowledgeable, friendly, and always quick to tackle any task or request. I cannot recommend him highly enough!"

"I hired Ryan to build an initial JAMF server for me, and it was a fantastic experience. Professional, easy to collaborate with, and helped me fill in gaps in my knowledge. Not only did I get a top-notch JAMF server, but I also gained better tools to optimize its use for me and my clients."

"We hired Ryan to assist us in deploying Jamf Connect for a fleet of 500+ endpoints. The project was extremely successful, and Ryan was exceptionally responsive. I highly recommend him for any company in need of an MDM expert."

"To say Ryan is incredible would be an understatement. Our macOS environment was in a rough state; we had outdated applications and operating systems, and things were starting to break for our end users. To make matters worse, staffing changes within IT left us with a Jamf environment that no one knew how to properly utilize. Ryan not only understood what was missing but also knew exactly how to fill those gaps. His expertise in macOS administration and Jamf is unmatched; not once did we have an unanswered question. He's responsive, pleasant to work with, and always willing to go the extra mile."
